# Stix, goal-oriented network management
This is one of the tools I developed as part of my PhD at the University of Edinburgh. There isn't much documentation around, but feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:mino@minux.it)!

Here a short abstract:
> Stix is a platform managing emerging large-scale broadband wireless access (BWA) networks. It has been developed to make it easy to manage such networks for community deployments and wireless Internet service providers while keeping the network management infrastructure scalable and flexible. Stix is based on the notions of goal-oriented and in-network management. With Stix, administrators graphically specify network management activities as workflows, which are deployed at a distributed set of agents within the network that cooperate in executing those work-flows and storing management information.
